autoRouterExploiter
===================

A program for automated router exploitation

Coded terribly, going to be completely overhauled soon.

6/23/2014 - IP counting and basic input finished

6/28/2014 - Scanning and a bit of logging in finished

TO DO: The rest of logins and the exploitation side of it.
